                     SOAP::Lite for Perl
                     ===================

SOAP::Lite for Perl is a collection of Perl modules which provides a simple 
and lightweight interface to the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) both 
on client and server side. 

To learn about SOAP, go to http://www.soaplite.com/#LINKS for more
information.

This version of SOAP::Lite supports a subset of the SOAP 1.1 specification
and has initial support for SOAP 1.2 specification.
See http://www.w3.org/TR/SOAP for details. 

FEATURES

- Supports SOAP 1.1 spec. 
- Interoperability tests with different implementations: Apache SOAP, Frontier, 
  Microsoft SOAP, Microsoft .NET, DevelopMentor, XMethods, 4s4c, Phalanx, 
  Kafka, SQLData, Lucin (in Java, Perl, C++, Python, VB, COM, XSLT). 
- Provides COM interface. Single dll (standalone [2.5MB] or minimal [32kB]). 
  Works on Windows 9x/Me/NT/2K. Doesn't require ROPE or MSXML. 
  Examples in VB, Excel/VBA, C#, ASP, JavaScript, PerlScript and Perl. 
- Provides transparent compression support for HTTP transport. 
- Provides mod_soap module. Make SOAP server with a few lines in .htaccess 
  or .conf file. 
- Includes XML::Parser::Lite (regexp-based XML parser) which runs instead 
  of XML::Parser where Perl 5.6 runs (even on WinCE) with some limitations. 
- Includes XMLRPC::Lite, implementation of XML-RPC protocol on client and 
  server side. All transports and features of SOAP::Lite are available. 
- Supports multipart/form-data MIME attachments. 
- Supports circular linked lists and multiple references. 
- Supports Map datatype (encoding of maps/hashes with arbitrary keys). 
- Supports HTTPS protocol. 
- Provides proxy support. 
- Provides CGI/daemon/mod_perl/Apache::Registry server implementations. 
- Provides TCP server implementation. 
- Provides IO (STDIN/STDOUT/File) server implementation. 
- Provides FTP client implementation. 
- Supports single/multipart MIME attachment (parsing side only). 
- Supports SMTP protocol. 
- Provides POP3 server implementation. 
- Supports M-POST and redirects in HTTP transport. 
- Supports Basic/Digest server authentication. 
- Works with CGI accelerators, like VelociGen and PerlEx. 
- Supports UDDI interface on client side. See UDDI::Lite for details. 
- Supports UDDI publishing API. Examples and documentation provided. 
- Supports WSDL schema with stub and run-time access. 
- Supports blessed object references. 
- Supports arrays (both serialization and deserialization with autotyping). 
- Supports custom serialization. 
- Provides exception transport with custom exceptions 
- Supports Base64 encoding. 
- Supports XML entity encoding. 
- Supports header attributes. 
- Supports dynamic and static class/method binding. 
- Supports objects-by-reference with simple garbage collection and activation. 
- Provides shell for interactive SOAP sessions. 
- Supports out parameters binding. 
- Supports transparent SOAP calls with autodispatch feature. 
- Provides easy services deployment. Put module in specified directory and 
  it'll be accessible. 
- Has tests, examples and documentation to let you be up and running in no time.

PREREQUISITES

This library has been tested by the author with Perl versions 5.005 
and 5.6.0 on different platforms: Windows 98/2K, Solaris 2.6, Linux 2.2. 
Should run everywhere where Perl 5.004 or later runs.

Some modules within this package depend on other packages that are
distributed separately from Perl. It supposes that you have the
following distributions installed before you install SOAP::Lite:

  XML::Parser

  You may not follow this requirement as soon as you have XML::Parser::Lite 
  (included), which will run automatically on Perl 5.00503 and later if 
  XML::Parser is not available.

Following modules will be loaded on demand only:

  XML::Parser::Expat (included with XML::Parser)
  MIME::Base64                                  
  URI (for HTTP/SMTP transport and autodispatch)
  HTTP::Daemon (for daemon server implementation, included with libwww-perl) 
  Apache (for mod_perl server implementation, included with mod_perl) 
  Net::POP3 and MIME::Parser (for POP3 server implementation)
  MIME::Lite (for SMTP client implementation)
  IO::File (for FTP client and IO server)
  Net::FTP (for FTP client)
  MQSeries (for MQSeries transport)
  Net::Jabber (for Jabber transport)
  FCGI (for FastCGI server implementation)
  IO::Socket::SSL (SSL support for TCP transport)
  MIME::Parser (for MIME attachment support)
  Compress::Zlib (for compression support)

Following modules will be used for HTTP protocol only:

  LWP::UserAgent (included with libwww-perl) 
  HTTP::Request (included with libwww-perl) 
  HTTP::Headers (included with libwww-perl) 
  HTTP::Status (included with libwww-perl) 
  Crypt::SSLeay (for HTTPS/SSL transfer)

These modules should be available from CPAN (http://search.cpan.org/).

INSTALLATION

You install SOAP::Lite as you would install any perl module library,
by running these commands:

if you have CPAN.pm installed and are connected to the Internet

   perl -MCPAN -e shell
   > install SOAP::Lite

or even 

   perl -MCPAN -e 'install SOAP::Lite'

otherwise

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Use nmake instead of make on Windows platform.

DOCUMENTATION

See lib/SOAP/Lite.pm for an overview of the library. Documentation is 
included in modules and scripts. These are normally converted to manual 
pages and installed as part of the "make install" process.  You should 
also be able to use the 'perldoc' utility to extract and read 
documentation from the module files directly.

LIMITATIONS

- Limited support for WSDL schema.
- XML::Parser::Lite relies on Unicode support in Perl and doesn't do entity
  decoding. 
- Limited support for mustUnderstand and Actor attributes. 

SUPPORT

Questions about how to use this library should be directed to the SOAP 
mailing list (http://discuss.develop.com/soap.html). Bug reports and 
suggestions for improvements can also be sent there. This mailing list is 
also the place for general discussions and development of the SOAP protocol 
itself. 
Feel free to send mail directly to author with your comments, suggestions, 
bug reports and complaints. 

AVAILABILITY

You can download the latest version SOAP::Lite for Unix or SOAP::Lite for 
Win32 from http://www.soaplite.com/ . 
SOAP::Lite is also available from CPAN ( http://search.cpan.org/ ). 

INCOMPATIBILITIES

Due to extensive interoperability tests and some interface changes
versions after 0.50 introduced possible incompatibilities with previous 
versions. Check this list for more information if you are upgrading 
to version 0.50 or later.
